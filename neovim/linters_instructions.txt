Install linters to check for errors 
-----------------------------------------
-- usually in react apps it isn't required as it is installed as a dependency 
-- but for normal files or vanilla js/python we need to install linters in system to check for errors 

1. javascript 
---------------------

- install es-lint globally  - npm install es-lint 
- npm init  (in home folder)
- es-lint init 

** Note- this could cause problems while running server for react apps as create-react-app utility comes with a version of es-lint which conflicts with system defaults 
-- to solve this we could us nvm 
-- or create a .env file in project folder and write:
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

-- also look for some effective solution to this. 


2. python 
---------------------

- :CocInstall coc-python 
-- after this install linter (it will ask when running if not present, also install globally)

- to configure linter for python 
:CocCommand 
-- then look for python.setLinter   =>  preferring pylint over flake8 for now.

Language Servers: 
Follow the link below to learn more about each specific language's language server, either we can install it or configure it in coc-settings.json (in most cases only one option is required) :
  --https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Language-servers#html 

eg: for python- :CocInstall coc-python  ( no need to configure in coc-settings.json file)
    for js - :CocInstall coc-tsserver

- must check this link if reconfiguring everything again
